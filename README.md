# Furniture-Sales-Pridiction
Introduction:
In an increasingly competitive furniture market, accurate sales forecasting is crucial for effective inventory management, resource allocation, and strategic decision-making. This project employs time series analysis techniques to predict future sales trends based on historical data.

Methodology:
The project begins with data collection and preprocessing, where historical sales data is cleaned and organized for analysis. Various time series forecasting methods, including ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and seasonal decomposition, are applied to identify patterns and trends in the sales data. Model selection and evaluation are conducted using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

Findings:
The analysis reveals significant seasonal fluctuations in furniture sales, with peak demand occurring during certain times of the year, such as holidays and seasonal promotions. The chosen forecasting models demonstrate strong predictive accuracy, accurately capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in sales data.

Implications:
Accurate sales forecasting enables businesses to optimize inventory levels, streamline production processes, and tailor marketing strategies to meet consumer demand more effectively. By leveraging insights from this time series analysis, furniture retailers can make informed decisions to enhance operational efficiency and maximize revenue potential.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the efficacy of time series analysis techniques in forecasting furniture sales. By harnessing the power of historical data and advanced forecasting models, businesses can gain valuable insights into future sales trends, enabling them to make proactive decisions to stay ahead in a dynamic and competitive market.
